# CycloneGame
## Description
This is an interactive game, similar to the cyclone arcade game. There are two neopixels that light up green on the CPX board, this is the target area. A blue light will move through all of the neopixels, and the player must use the left button (button A) on the CPX board, to stop the blue light in the target area. 

## Inputs
The CPX slide switch turns the game on and off. Button A on the CPX board stops the blue light from moving and checks if the blue light was stopped in the target area.

## Outputs
All the neopixels light up green and a high tone plays if the blue light was stopped in target area. All the neopixels light up red and a low tone plays if the blue light wasn't stopped in target area.
